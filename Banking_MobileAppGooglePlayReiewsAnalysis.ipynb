You have to click a button in the upper right corner. 2) When you view the side menu, you can't dismiss the menu by swiping it away. You have to click on a small button to collapse the menu.

That was really hard to do. Most apps, if they're going to blank out a security code with asterisks at least give the user one second to see what was keyed in with one's fingers on the touch screen. Citibank doesn't do this. All 16 digits of the ATM card must be entered without knowing if they're being entered correctly. Next, one would also think that if one taps the ATM card number field to enter the ATM card number, that one would then tap the Birth Date field to enter the date of birth, but not with this app! One has to tap a small icon of the number \"12\" on the far right side of the Birth Date field which displays 3 drop down menus for month, day and year. However, drop downs disappear with each selection. So, one has to tap the 12 and pick the month; tap 12 and pick the day; tap 12 and pick the year. Finally, it is possible to take a picture of the check and tap submit, which results in a red error message that says \"a serious error occurred\", so one must click the submit button again to complete the deposit. : 2013-01-15 22:09:49\n",

Most of my frustration comes from the registration process (seriously - three security questions plus a secret pass phrase?), but the biggest reason for the two stars is that by not allowing the full array of special characters, it shows that the code handling the password is not handling the input correctly - and if it can crash the system, then this is an additional red flag. To reproduce this, enter a password with '<' and ignore the notice that passwords should only have a subset of special characters - and hit \"go' from the android keyboard.

That would all be tolerable, but I have had a laundry list of issues with actually using this app. Whenever it appears they've fixed a problem, they create a new one. Here is just a sampling:  - fingerprint reader issues: where the setting is turned on, but still forces me to login with my password (seems to be recently fixed, we'll see...). - as of two weeks or so ago, I cannot make payments on my account through the app. I've been forced to login online each time. As someone who pays off my card as I go, this is extremely frustrating. - also with the recent issues, I can no longer access my rewards through the app. - random crashes (always has been a problem) - Citi MasterPass? Never used it or even know what it is because it doesn't load in the app. Not going out of my way to find out either.  There are more examples, but this should give a robust enough overview to the developers that they need more quality control.
